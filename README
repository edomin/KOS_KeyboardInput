C-language keyboard input library for KolibriOS.

Building:
1. Open Makefile and change TOOLCHAIN variable (1st string) to path to kos32 
   toolchain in your system.
2. You need MSYS. Get it if you have not it. Open MSYS, move to 
   KOS_KeyboardInput folder and type:
    make
For rebuild library type:
    make clean
    make
    
Usage:
Use header "kos_ki.h" and lib "libkos_ki.a" for attach library to your project

Header overview:
int KeyboardInit(void) - library initialization. Returns 0 on success.
void KeyboardQuit(void)  - must be called for freeing keys' structures.
void KeyboardKeystatesRefresh(void) - must be called every program loop cycle 
  before checking keys' presses.
bool KeyboardKeyPress(uint8_t key) - return true if key was pressed
bool KeyboardKeyRelease(uint8_t key) - return true if key was released
bool KeyboardKeyPressed(uint8_t key) - return true if key pressed now
There is KOS_KEY_<KEYNAME> constants - KOS_KEY_A, KOS_KEY_B, KOS_KEY_CAPSLOCK 
etc. Watch header for full list. That constant names uses in 
functions where is "uint8_t key" argument.
